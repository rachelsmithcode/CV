In code I discovered something that would feed two of my greatest passions, creating beautiful things and my delight in puzzles. To date I have found few things as satisfying as well written, readable code.

A voracious crafter, when someone has a good idea at the pub I'm the one that e-mails them the next day with an itemized list and diagrams detailing how to make it happen.

I am looking for a role with a company that will constantly challenge me to further my learning and push myself to achieve in a supportive team environment.


## Skills

### Careful communicator

Hopefully my CV will attest the truth of this for me.

Overcoming my natural shyness has had the dual benefit of making me a better listener and more attentive to the choice of words I use. I have also seen the damage bad communication can do to a project and strive to negate this wherever possible.

#####On Canary Wharf's IT Helpdesk as first line support:

  + Being able to briefly summarize a problem with       all relevant details was essential.

  + Honed my ability for teasing out relevant technical information from people who often had limited experience with technology and were understandably short on time and patience.

From executive to project manager, security guard to project secretary I received glowing words of thanks and appreciation.

#####Receptionist at L39 Technology Accelerator:

  Due to Level39's structure the reception team were employed by contractors working for Canary
  Wharf Group. This gave us the opportunity of working with the Level39 Management team to meet the day to day needs of scores of start up companies.

  However due to the number of people involved without smooth communication relationships could break down with frightening speed. Reception was worked closely with all teams:

  + I focused on keeping this communication clear and healthy.

  + I adjusted my tone and manner as required for the situation.

  I believe this skill was one of those primarily responsible for my promotion to head of the reception team.


### Enthusiastic learner

Eager and able to learn new skill and technologies quickly.

- This was put to the test most rigorously at Makers academy where I managed to produce projects in over 10 different lanaguages/frameworks in 12 weeks. 7 of these were part of the curriculum, 3 we just picked up for fun and because they suited the task at hand.

You are already on my GitHub, take a look around!

- Projects of particular interest may be:

  - Nodeboard - using express and node JS for lab week, a free choice week. Chosen because full stack js sounded cool, it is. This project also allowed practice creating restful APIs and used of Mongo DB, TDD driven, (as is the Makers way).

  - OctoSearch - Working with external APIs, namely GitHub's to allow a comprehensive user search with an awfully pretty front end.
  https://github.com/rachelsmithcode/octo-search.git

  - Museum Passport - Makers Academy final project, composed of two separate repos, front end used Ionic, (because we figured, what the hey lets learn one more new technology for the road) and the back end, restful API was made in rails

### Tenacious probelm-solver

Sole Production Manager for one of the largest independent record labels in the UK.

  + Despite having no experience in the particular area of physical product production. The company were responsible for almost all my work experience to that point and trusted my skills as a resourceful, probelm-solver to deliver projects as needed.

  + Undertaken during the busiest time in the companies 26 year history, working with artists such as The Cult and Marlyn Manson and requiring precise production orders be placed for tens of thousands of units globally.

This was certainly a huge responsibility but getting the CDs, in store and on time stands as proof of my success.
